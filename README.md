# Python Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges! Here, I document my journey of tackling these festive puzzles using Python, with a unique twist. For each problem, I start by crafting a solution based on my own logic and understanding. Once I've given it my best shot, I then create an alternative solution with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT, aiming for a more Pythonic and often more efficient approach.

## Repository Structure

- `day-1`:
  - `my-solution-1.py`: My initial solution to the first problem of the day.
  - `my-solution-2.py`: My initial solution to the second problem of the day.
  - `gpt-solution-1.py`: GPT-assisted, Pythonic solution to the first problem.
  - `gpt-solution-2.py`: GPT-assisted, Pythonic solution to the second problem.
  - `input.txt`: The puzzle input data.
  - `task-1.md`: Description and reflection on the first task.
  - `task-2.md`: Description and reflection on the second task.

## Approach

For each day's challenge, I start by understanding the problem and then writing a solution that solves it. This initial solution is purely my own creation, without external influences. Afterward, I consult with GPT to provide a second solution, which often includes more advanced Python features or a different logic approach that may be more efficient or elegant.

This dual-approach not only allows me to practice and improve my own coding skills but also gives me insights into different programming styles and techniques that can be learned from AI-assisted programming.

## How to Run the Solutions

Each day's folder contains scripts for both my original solutions and the GPT-assisted versions. To run any script, navigate to the appropriate directory and use Python to execute the script:

```bash
python my-solution-1.py
```
